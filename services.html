              <p class="">Most recently, TNQ set up an offshore development centre for an American publishing services company. This is a culmination of years of partnership between the two companies in jointly delivering pre-publishing services to some of the most prestigious American society publishers. The ODC will gradually offshore all of the customer's development, maintenance and support, and will be the primary hub for future joint initiatives that target the American market.</p>

              <p> Publisher-focused application development is a mature practice at TNQ. For a UK-based publisher with editorial resources distributed worldwide, we developed a freelance management solution,  now in Version 2, which we maintain and support. In engagements such as this, our customers enjoy the fact that we do not need too much briefing, or lengthy phases of requirements gathering and definition. Basically our domain depth translates to cost efficiency and time to market. </p>

            <p> To control the quality of XML, we built a client application for a Netherlands-based global leader in STM publishing. It substantially improved quality and productivity. We have enhanced the application in a subsequent release, building a satellite over the base system to let users enrich the content with semantic tagging. Applications that we develop may be production-oriented or author-facing. A development of the latter type is a cast-off calculator, commissioned for one of the most prestigious American journals. The application resides in the journal's submission system, picks up the submitted manuscript, paginates it on the fly and shows to authors whether their submission has exceeded the page limit or not.</p><div class="quotes-txt">Applications that we develop may be production-oriented or author-facing, and they benefit both. </div>

              <p class=""> Our publishing software services practice began when we took over a legacy application that had been entrusted to another vendor, a much larger, well-established company, we must add. It was our David vs. Goliath moment. We took it over, reengineered it in a more contemporary technology idiom, making it lighter and more easily futurable. It is an XML validation tool that the publisher's entire production output has to pass through. This enormously important application is continuously enhanced and supported by TNQ, for seven years now. </p>

            <div class="semantic-cnt">
              <p class=""> All applications ever developed or reengineered by TNQ have stayed with us for subsequent maintenance, support, and in many cases, enhancement. The level of support is customer-calibrated. There is live support when needed. A significant aspect of this line of service is our production support. Very often, TNQ is the go-to vendor for large rollouts involving a novelty in the production process. We are in the advanced stages of pilot for 24-hour article production. We are into Phase 2 of a very large experiment to revolutionise the way STM content is produced, used and shared. </p>

               I would actually give a 9.6 to this area of quality satisfaction and reliability. TNQ is a premier supplier having excellent dedicated team for us. I wish they were even more a part of us so we could integrate our efforts much quicker and easier and include the TNQ team at higher level meetings for collaborative projects once it has been decided that TNQ has won a project.

              I think Proof Central runs well and has proven to be reliable. Also here, I think TNQ is doing a good job. One comment: there are some usability aspects of the TNQ support system that can be improved.
