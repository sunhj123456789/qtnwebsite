              <p>Historically, TNQ has been strong with Chemistry and the Bio-medical Sciences. It is a different level of editing when you do it to consistent appreciation for North American Health Sciences, global leaders in Chemistry publishing and prestigious societies that demand attention to detail. To quote the Editor of one of the most cited cell biology journals: Many thanks for your kind note and incredibly impressive editing of our manuscript - the most comprehensive I've ever seen in 35 years of science! An author for the world's pre-eminent open access chemistry journal says: I found no single error in the proof. So far, I have published over 150 papers and it has happened for the first time to me.</p>

              <p> In a publishing landscape that increasingly treats content as data, copy editing and language polishing become an act of mark up. It helps that all our editors know XML and can create intelligent tags to enhance the content for greater discoverability. Some of our editors understand subject-specific ontologies that such enhancement requires. With the weight of automation behind them, they rise to complex editorial tasks that demand both natural language and the language of science.</p>

              <p> As we work on migrating our copy editing tools from the desktop application environment to the browser, let us look at the discipline's intelligent side. The copyeditors at TNQ, well-versed in various scientific disciplines, appreciate author's concerns and respect the content and its expression. With a copy editing team of post-graduates, MPhils, and PhDs, drawn from reputed academic institutions, TNQ has emerged as the preferred supplier among clients in the US, UK and EU, especially for those assignments that demand a little something extra - either in terms of handling complex styles, or in terms of turnaround, or a high level of editing, if that is what is needed, or a combination of these. </p>

              <p>TNQ has earned its reputation working with well known STM publishers on the one hand and prestigious societies on the other. This varied experience means: TNQ can manage several different styles, including hybrids. TNQ has moved into collaborative copy editing, working online with on-shore editors. For effective collaboration, we have streamlined workflows. While manual editing skills enhance quality, copy editing tools developed by TNQ increase efficiency. Originally designed for internal use, these are increasingly becoming the tools of the trade, with implementations at client sites across US and Europe.</p>
